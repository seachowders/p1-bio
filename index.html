		<h3>BlurB</h3>
		<p class="grid_6">I have lived in the Spokane area since the summer of 2008.  I am a firm believer that if you work hard you should play hard, and that there is a time and place for nearly anything.  I strive to live in the moment, while at the same time remaining concsious and aware of what may be around the next bend in this path we all walk together.
		I married the love my life Sarah, in December of 2012.

			<h3>Hobbies as Escapism</h3>
			<p>The 'battle' for peace of mind has been waged for as long as humanity has existed.  I think that in our digital age, with our brains are receiving and processing more information than ever, actively pursuing peace of mind has never been more important.  I gravitate towards activities that are able to put me in a state in which I am fully engaged in the moment and time seems to disappear. </p>

					<p>I lump these together because I enjoy things that all three share, regardless of the medium.  While I enjoy analysis in certain contexts, I actively choose to experience media most often as a form of entertainment.  I relish great storytelling and enjoy works that are able to immerse you in the life of another person.
